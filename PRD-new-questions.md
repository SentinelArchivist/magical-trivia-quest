# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Expansion: 100 New Multiple-Choice Questions per Level (Levels 1–4)

---

## 1. Objective

Expand the game’s question pool by adding **100 entirely new, original multiple-choice questions** to each of difficulty levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. All questions must be unique, evenly distributed across the five universes (Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Zelda), and strictly multiple-choice format.

---

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Data Structure & Storage
- New questions must follow the existing JSON format in the `data/` directory.
- Each question object must include:
  - `questionText`: The question prompt.
  - `answers`: Array of possible answers (minimum 3, ideally 4).
  - `correctAnswer`: The correct answer (must match one of the entries in `answers`).
  - `universe`: One of: `"Disney"`, `"Marvel"`, `"Star Wars"`, `"Pixar"`, `"Zelda"`.
  - `difficulty`: Integer (1–4).
  - Any other fields required by the current data model.

### 2.2 Distribution & Uniqueness
- For each of levels 1–4:
  - 100 new questions per level, 20 per universe.
- All questions must be original and not duplicates, restatements, or trivial variants of existing questions.
- Each question must be thematically appropriate for its universe and difficulty level.

### 2.3 Multiple-Choice Format
- Every question must have at least three answer choices (preferably four).
- Only one answer may be correct; distractors must be plausible.

### 2.4 Integration & Integrity
- The new questions must be integrated into the appropriate JSON files in `data/` (or as required by the current codebase).
- No changes to code logic, structure, or data model are permitted unless strictly necessary for compatibility.
- Maintain all existing validation, loading, and gameplay logic—no breaking changes.
- All new data must pass any existing tests and validation scripts.

### 2.5 Testing & Quality Assurance
- After integration, run all existing tests to ensure no regressions.
- Spot-check a sample of new questions for correctness, formatting, and gameplay suitability.
- If automated tests exist for question loading and display, ensure 100% pass rate.

### 2.6 Documentation
- Update any relevant documentation (e.g., README, data format docs) to note the expanded question pool and guidelines for future additions.

## 3. Out of Scope

- No changes to skill tree, XP, UI, or any other gameplay mechanics.
- No backend changes or introduction of new technologies.
- No use of mock data in production.

---

## 4. Impact Analysis

- **System-wide impacts are minimal** as long as the existing data format and logic are preserved.
- The main effect will be a richer and more varied gameplay experience, especially for replayability.
- The only risk is data bloat or performance issues if the question pool becomes extremely large, but 400 new questions is well within reasonable bounds for a modern PWA.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

- 100 new, unique, multiple-choice questions per level (1–4), evenly split across all five universes.
- All questions integrated and validated with no regressions or gameplay issues.
- No changes to existing code logic or data model integrity.
- All tests pass and documentation is up to date.
